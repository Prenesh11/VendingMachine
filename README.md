Hi and welcome

1. I have created this application with the embedded DB SQLite.
2. You can just import the project into intellij, resolve maven dependencies and build. I have used JDK8.
3. I have also added the postman collection the project to make it simple to test, Jason file name ="Vending Machine Postman Collection.postman_collection.json"
   and will be on the root of the project folder.
4. Please ensure you run the collections populateProductTable & populateCashFlowTable in order to populate the db tables. these commands are designed to work only
   when the DB is empty.
5. Please contact me should you require any additional assistance.
